			<h3>What you need to get started</h3>
				<p> 
					First you will need a bolt rifle and decent optics. The reason I say a bolt gun, is because by nature, they are more accurate out of the box than say an AR platform.

			<h3>Best <span style="color: red">ammo</span> choices for your gun</h3>
				<p>
					The reason there is such a big demand for the "best" ammo you can find without loading it yourself is as follows.<br> Military ammo is usually steel cased and over time will ruin your barrel, this ammo is by far the cheapest.
					<br> Treat ammo like you would optics, spend the money on decent ammo with good balastics.
