			<h3>What you need to get started</h3>
				<p> 
					First you will need a bolt rifle and decent optics. The reason I say a bolt gun, is because by nature, they are more accurate out of the box and say an AR platform.

			<h3>Best <span style="color: red">ammo</span> choices for your gun</h3>
				<p>
					The reason there is such a big demand for the "best" ammo you can find without loading it yourself is as follows. Military ammo is usually steel cased and over time will ruin your barrel, this ammo is by far the cheapest. Treat ammo like you would optics, spend the money on decent ammo with good balastics.
